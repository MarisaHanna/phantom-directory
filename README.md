#       Employee Search Directory 


#       Description

This project simulates an application that allows the user to search for all employees within their company. Search results can be narrowed down by either searching for a specific employee by name, or search for all the employees that are located in a specific state. All employee cards display the employees' name, email, phone, employee ID, and DOB.
